### A Note on Contributions


Project 3 Group 3

Team members: Zhongxing Xue, Keran Li, Mingming Liu, Junkai Zhang, Yuhan Zha

Summary: Project summary: In this project, we improved a classification baseline model for images of dogs, fried chickens and blueberry muffins in terms of ruing time cost and prediction accuracy. The baseline model for comparison uses Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) with decision stumps on 2000 SIFT features. Our group uses 3 image feature selection models, including SIFT, RGB, LBP and the arbitrary combinations of them, and 8 classification models, including GBM, SVM, XgBoost, Random Forest, Neural Network, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression and Classification Trees. The procedure as follows:

Contribution statement: 
Zhongxing Xue organized the team work and discussion, and led the whole team to make analysis and summary. ZX put forward the Image RGB feature, and wrote code to calculate them. ZX was also responsible for GBM model. Zhongxing was the presenter of the group, and he designed the powerpoint.
Keran Li: coded the Neural Network Model, Logistic Regression Model and their cross validation in R. Coded the LBP and PCA feature selection function. Wrote the readme file for the project.
Mingming Liu: coded the Adaboosting Model and Randomforest Model and their cross validation in R. Responsible for organized the test and train document and help Xue to prepared for the explaination of determined colors.
Junkai Zhang: coded the cross validation and grid search procedure of XgBoost Model in R and prepared plots for the powerpoint.
Yuhan Zha: coded the SVM model and classfication tree model and their cross validation in R. Researched LBP feature selection method. Conducted the main.Rmd and main.R.
